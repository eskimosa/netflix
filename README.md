Intro
--

This Netflix clone is built using Django REST Framework on the backend and React.js on the frontend, fetching data from a third-party API and storing each category in a dedicated PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data management.

User authentication is managed with Django and JWT for secure login and session handling.
On the frontend, a custom AuthProvider and useAuth() hook handle session management, storing the JWT securely and dynamically updating the appâ€™s state to protect routes and maintain user sessions.

The entire project is fully Dockerized, simplifying deployment and scaling for production environments.
